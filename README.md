To Everyone,

Currently, due to changes in PsyArXiv’s operational policy (transition to strict pre-moderation), previously published papers have become inaccessible. Since the review process will require a certain period of time, we will implement a temporary measure by making the papers available on GitHub.

Paper published on GitHub:
A Dynamical Model of Subjectivity: Integrating Affective Gain, Cognitive Bias, and Self-Regulation (Version 7)

File Name: Dynamical_Subjectivity_Model_Ver_1_AppendixE_F_G.pdf
